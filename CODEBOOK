The script run_analysis.R will perform the follwoing steps:

1. Read the relevant data (test data and training data are separate)
2. Read the labels for the x_* data and the translation of the activities
3. Clean up the labels so they do not contain steering information ()
4. Add the labels to the train and test data
5. Unstrip the x_test and x_train data with the only necessary columns (mean & std)
6. Gather the subjects, the activity and the data together for test and the training
7. Create one data set by putting test and training data together
8. Replace the number of the activity by its expression 
9. Create a data frame with the mean of each variable per subject and activity. The result will be stored in the object "summmary"
